### <img height="20" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif"> Hi there, I'm Gabriel Rodrigues 

I'm a brazilian developer graduated in Information Systems, passionate about technology and software development having experience in projects with Javascript.

Currently I'm working on a company as a fullstack developer, creating solutions to help people get their driver's license using a distance learning platform. In this company I also develop a software that manages the process to get license vehicles plates.

I had an experience working with frontend development on a company, creating interfaces for a warehouse management system.

I have 3 years of experience working at the State Department of Development and Innovation of the State of Goi√°s where I had an intense contact with technology in different stages of the software development process, like documentation, automated tests, database, versioning control and continuous integration. 

I recently participated in the hackathon of the Federal University of Goias where my team and I developed a project to help students in the preparation of the final thesis and we won the first place.
