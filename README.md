### Hi there, I'm Gabriel Rodrigues ðŸ‘‹


I'm a brazilian developer graduated in Information Systems, passionate about technology and software development having experience in projects with Javascript. I'm in constant study, focused on becoming a better developer, creating applications with the best performance, great experiences, and most important, keeping things easy for users.

I had an experience working with frontend development on a company, creating interfaces for a warehouse management system where I've learn a lot of things using ReactJS using a lot of awesome libraries.

I have 3 years of experience working at the State Department of Development and Innovation of the State of GoiÃ¡s where I had an intense contact with technology in different stages of the software development process, like documentation, automated tests, database, versioning control and continuous integration. 

I recently participated in the hackathon of the Federal University of Goias where my team and I developed a project to help students in the preparation of the final thesis and we won the first place.
